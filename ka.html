            How can we ignore Kashmir when talking about the best natural places in India? This natural paradise on earth is one of the best places for nature lovers in India. Lavishly sprawled between the Karakoram range and Pir Panjal range, Kashmir is an eternally beautiful place with far too many things to offer. From sightseeing to admiring its pristine beauty and participating in adventure activities, this place in India is an ultimate choice to bask in the lap of nature.

           <h2><b>Best Time to Visit Kashmir:</b></h2> The best time to visit Kashmir is from October through February, as the valley is a visual delight in winter.
