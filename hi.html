            Can you imagine Switzerland in India or even better than its beauty? You must visit Khajjiar in Himachal Pradesh which is a surrogate of Switzerland to believe me. India's mini Switzerland is not only famous for its scenic beauty but is among the list of top 10 nature places in India. Apart from offering gorgeous views of snow-capped Himalayan peaks, Khajjiar is a popular destination for tourists due to its expansive meadows and abundant forest. Major attractions of Khajjiar include the Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary and Dal Lake.

<h2><b>Best Time to Visit Khajjiar:</b></h2> Visiting India's mini Switzerland is best from March to October.
